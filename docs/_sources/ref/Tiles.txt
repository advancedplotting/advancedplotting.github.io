Tile Plot
=========

Display a 2D array as a series of colored tiles.

Supply a 2D array of data; it will be displayed as a series of rectangles
(tiles) colored according to a colormap.  The tile boundaries along X and Y
may optionally be specified.  This VI differs from :ref:`vi_arrayview` in
that the tiles appear as discrete units, with no smoothing applied.  It is the
same approach as used with :ref:`vi_histogram2d`.

By default, no lines are shown between tiles.  This may be adjusted via
the *Line* entry in the property cluster.

|double_2d_in| **Z Data**
    2D data to display.
    
|double_1d_in| **X Tile Boundaries**
    Optional locations of the tile edge locations.  Note that if **Z Data**
    has NX elements in the X direction, this array should have NX+1 elements.
    Defaults to 0..NX.
    
|double_1d_in| **Y Tile Boundaries**
    Optional locations of the tile edge locations.  Note that if **Z Data**
    has NY elements in the Y direction, this array should have NY+1 elements.
    Defaults to 0..NY.
    
|tiles_props| **Properties**
    Property cluster, available under the "Properties" subpalette.
        
    |cluster_in| **Colormap**
        Controls the colormap used to color the tiles.

    |cluster_in| **Line**
        Controls the appearance of the lines between tiles.  Note: only
        "Automatic" and "Solid" styles are currently supported; other styles
        will be ignored.

    |cluster_in| **Display**
        Controls general appearance of the tile plot.

Other information
-----------------

If **Z Data** is empty, no plot is made.

If either **X Tile Boundaries** or **Y Tile Boundaries** has less than two
entries, or contains non-finite entries (NaN or Inf), it will be ignored and
the defaults (0..NX and 0..NY) will be used.
