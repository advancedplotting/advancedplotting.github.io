Other information
-----------------

If tick values are given which are offscreen, the plot will be expanded to
display them.  See :ref:`vi_limits` to set the X and Y axis ranges explicitly.

Non-finite (NaN or Inf) entries in **Tick Locations** are ignored, as are
corresponding entries in **Tick Labels**.

If the axis scale is log or symlog, error :ref:`error_scale` will result.
