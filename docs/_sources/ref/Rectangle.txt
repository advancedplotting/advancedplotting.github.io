Draw Rectangle
==============

Draw a rectangle, in data coordinates.

Places a rectangle on the plot, by specifying the X and Y location of the
lower-left corner, along with width and height.  This VI may also be used
with polar plots, in which case the "rectangle" is a wedge.

Axis Types
----------

This VI supports both polar and rectanguar axes, as well as linear and log
scales.  However, use with symlog scales is not currently supported, and will
result in error :ref:`error_scale`.

Errors
------

* :ref:`error_scale`
* :ref:`error_invalid`
* :ref:`error_plotting`
* :ref:`error_init`

Other information
-----------------

If **X Position** or **Y Position** is non-finite, no rectangle is drawn.
If **Width** or **Height** is non-finite or zero, no rectangle is drawn.
Negative heights and widths are permitted.
