View Plot As Picture
====================

Render the plot to a LabVIEW picture, so it can be displayed.

By default, the plot will be rendered using whatever size it currently has
(see :ref:`vi_size`).  To exactly match the dimensions of an existing Picture
control, wire a control reference to the **Ref for Sizing** terminal.

.. note::

    To save your plot to a file on disk, use :ref:`vi_save`.
