<p>The simplicity and power of the Advanced Plotting Toolkit is made possible by
&#8220;standing on the shoulders of giants&#8221;, and making use of existing,
high-quality, well-tested, and widely deployed technology components.</p>
<p>Foremost among these is the industry-leading <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>
plotting library, which the Toolkit uses as a central component of the
plotting subsystem.  In addition to core technology such as anti-aliased plots,
many of the advanced Toolkit features, including
<a class="reference internal" href="markup.html#guide-latex"><span>inline math markup</span></a>,
and <a class="reference internal" href="polar.html#guide-polar"><span>polar plots</span></a>, are made possible by the

                                AUTHOR

David H. Munro wrote Yorick and Gist.  Berkeley Yacc (byacc) generated
the Yorick parser.  The routines in Math are from LAPACK and FFTPACK;
MathC contains C translations by David H. Munro.  The algorithms for
Yorick's random number generator and several special functions in
Yorick/include were taken from Numerical Recipes by Press, et. al.,
although the Yorick implementations are unrelated to those in
Numerical Recipes.  A small amount of code in Gist was adapted from
the X11R4 release, copyright M.I.T. -- the complete copyright notice
may be found in the (unused) file Gist/host.c.
